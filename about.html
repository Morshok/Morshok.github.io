                    And I am currently a student at Chalmers University of Technology.
                    I began my studies at Chalmers about 3 years ago, studying <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/sv/utbildning/program-pa-grundniva/Sidor/Datateknik-180.aspx">Computer Engineering</a>. 
                    During the last year of my Bachelor's Degree in <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/sv/utbildning/program-pa-grundniva/Sidor/Datateknik-180.aspx">Computer Engineering</a>, 
                    I got to take some courses in <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/programmes/masters-info/Pages/Data-Science.aspx">Data Science and AI</a>, 
                    which really got me interested in taking a Master's Degree including said topic. That is why I'm now continuing my studies at Chalmers for another 2 years until I hopefully get 
                    a Master's Degree in <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/programmes/masters-info/Pages/Computer-Science-algorithms-languages-and-logic.aspx">Computer Science</a>.

                As a person I'm hopefully perceived by others as outgoing. I really enjoy having conversations about 
                various topics with other people as long as I'm not expected to do "all the heavy lifting". With that said,
                I have grown to become a team player. It wasn't always like this though. Throughout most of my childhood 
                I was often the only responsible person in a group, which over the years made me despise group assignments.
                During my years at Chalmers however, I've met and worked with a lot of wonderful people who did their part. 
                Other than that, I would say I'm a very organized person overall, and I often pay attention to detail. 
                I'm open-minded and over the years I also developed a "growth mindset". I also firmly believe that we as 
                human beings should develop our professional skills and learn new things all the time.
