Title:
Hi there! My name is Anthon Lenander,

Qualifications:
and I am currently a student at Chalmers University of Technology.
I began my studies at Chalmers about 3 years ago, studying Computer Technology (https://www.chalmers.se/sv/utbildning/program-pa-grundniva/Sidor/Datateknik-180.aspx). 
During the last year of my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Technology, I got to take some courses in 
Data Science and AI, which really got me interested in taking a Master's Degree in said topics. 
That is why I intend on continuing my studies at Chalmers for another 2 years until I hopefully 
get a Master's Degree in Data Science and AI. 

Qualities:
As a person I'm hopefully perceived by others as outgoing. I really enjoy having conversations about 
various topics with other people as long as I'm not expected to "do all the heavy lifting". With that said,
I have grown to become a team player. It wasn't always like this though. Throughout most of my childhood 
I was often the only responsible person in a group, which over the years made me despise group assignments.
During my years at Chalmers however, I've met and worked with a lot of wonderful people who did their part. 
Other than that, I would say I'm a very organized person overall, and I often pay attention to detail. 
I'm open-minded and over the years I also developed a "growth mindset". I also firmly believe that we as 
human beings should develop our professional skills and learn new things all the time.

If these are qualities and qualifications you are looking for in a future employee, then feel free to send
me an email through the form on the contact page. I will be available for employment in about 2
years. Hope to see you then!
